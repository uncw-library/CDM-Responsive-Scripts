NOTE:

Contentdm requires these files to be renamed on each upload:  custom.css, custom.js, custom_home.html.

If one uploads any file to contentdm without first renaming it, there is a chance the contentdm will ignore the file.



These are copies of custom files the contentdm admin may be uploading to contentdm.

The most reliable source for these files is to load https://digitalcollections.uncw.edu/ in your browser & save the files via the browser's developer tools.

But maybe this repo gives some version control history for uncw's custom contentdm files.  If not, feel free to archive this repo.

Another copy of these files (maintained by the librarians) is at libstore/library/digital_collections/contentdm_homepage_backup.

The version control process is ambiguous for these files, so it's likely that the most useful source is scraping them from the digitalcollections.uncw.edu page.
