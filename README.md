These are copies of custom files the contentdm admin may be uploading to contentdm.

The most reliable source for these files is to load https://digitalcollections.uncw.edu/ in your browser & save the files via the browser's developer tools.

But maybe this repo gives some version control history for uncw's custom contentdm files.  If not, feel free to archive this repo.

Another copy of these files (maintained by the librarians) is at libstore/library/digital_collections/contentdm_homepage_backup.

The version control process is vague for this project, so it's likely that the most useful version of these files is scraping them from the digitalcollections.uncw.edu page.
